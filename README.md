# H&M-Customer-Transaction-Analysis
This project analyzed H&Mâ€™s customer purchase data to uncover patterns in clothing preferences and purchasing habits. By identifying these patterns, we optimized inventory management and enhanced the overall shopping experience. The primary issue addressed was the lack of precise insights into what drives customer purchases at H&M. According to McKinsey (2023), retailers often struggle with excess inventory or stockouts due to unpredictable demand. We identified common purchasing trends, such as top-selling clothing categories in specific seasons, repeat purchase frequency, and frequently bought-together items. These insights enabled H&M to refine its product offerings and minimize losses from unsold inventory. As Forbes (2023) highlighted, predicting demand trends helps reduce waste and improve supply chain efficiency. This project provided multiple benefits, including increased profitability through better inventory control and marketing strategies, enhanced product availability and personalized shopping experiences for customers, and stronger financial performance for investors through data-driven decision-making.
