# H-M-Customer-Transaction-Analysis
This project will look at H&M’s customer purchase data to uncover patterns in clothing preferences and purchasing habits. By identifying these patterns, we will help optimize inventory management and enhance the overall shopping experience. The primary issue we address is the lack of precise insights into what drives customer purchases at H&M. According to McKinsey, retailers often struggle with excess inventory or stockouts due to unpredictable demand (McKinsey, 2023). We aim to identify common purchasing trends such as which clothing categories sell best in specific seasons, how frequently customers make repeat purchases, and which items are often bought together. These insights will enable H&M to refine its product offerings and minimize losses from unsold inventory. According to Forbes, predicting demand trends can help reduce waste and improve supply chain efficiency. (Forbes, 2023). This project benefits multiple stakeholders by increasing H&M’s profitability through better inventory control and marketing efficiency, enhancing product availability and personalized shopping experiences for customers, and driving stronger financial performance for investors through data-backed decision-making.
