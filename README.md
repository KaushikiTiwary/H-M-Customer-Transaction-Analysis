# H-M-Customer-Transaction-Analysis
This project will look at H&amp;Mâ€™s customer purchase data to uncover patterns in clothing preferences and purchasing habits. By identifying these patterns, we will help optimize inventory management and enhance the overall shopping experience. The primary issue we address is the lack of precise insights into what drives customer purchases at H&amp;M.
